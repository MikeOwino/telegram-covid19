Preliminary safety data from a Phase 1 (ChiCTR2000030906; NCT04313127) clinical trial of 108 participants between 18 and 60 years old who will receive low, medium, and high doses of Ad5-nCoV has allowed the company to plan to initiate a Phase 2 trial, according to an announcement. The Phase 2 (ChiCTR2000031781) trial has identical inclusion criteria. Outcomes: A single dose of Ad5-nCoV protected against upper respiratory infection of SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets, according to a paper published 14 August in Nature Communications. Results from the Phase 1 trial show a humoral and immunogenic response to the vaccine, according to a paper published in The Lancet. Adverse reactions such as pain (54%), fever (46%), fatigue (44%), headache (39%), and muscle pain (17%) occurred in 83% of patients in the low and medium dose groups and 75% of patients in the high dose group. In the Phase 2 trial, neutralizing antibodies and specific interferon \u03b3 enzyme-linked immunospot assay responses were observed at all dose levels for most participants. Status: On 25 June, China\u2019s Central Military Commission announced the military had been approved to use Ad5-nCoV for a period of 1 year, according to reporting in Reuters. The Phase 3 trial is underway at sites in Saudi Arabia and Russia.",

The team has previously developed a MERS vaccine. In India, the candidate is being jointly developed by the Serum Institute of India and AstraZeneca, and goes by the name Covishield. Preclinical data on the pre-print server bioRxiv showed a significantly reduced viral load and &ldquo;humoral and cellular immune response.&rdquo; Another pre-print paper showed an immune response in mice and pigs. Study Designs: A Phase 1/2 (NCT04324606) single-blinded, multi-center study of 1,090 healthy adult volunteers aged 18-55 years with four treatment arms. A Phase 3 trial (NCT04516746), for which AstraZeneca released the clinical study protocol, is underway and has enrolled more than 40,000 participants. An inhaled version of the vaccine candidate is being tested in a small trial of 30 people.  Outcomes: Preliminary results from the trial published in The Lancet showed the vaccine candidate had an &ldquo;acceptable safety profile&rdquo; with most patients demonstrating an antibody response after one dose and all patients showing a response after two doses. There has been one death in a Phase 3 trial in Brazil, which was confirmed by the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa). AstraZeneca announced that results from the Phase 3 trial show an immunogenicity response, but have not yet publicly released any data.

JNJ-78436735 is a part of Operation Warp Speed.  Study Design: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1/2a study of recombinant JNJ-78436735 in 1,045 healthy participants 18-55 years of age, and adults 65 years or older.

A Phase 1 trial (NCT04283461) of 105 healthy participants provided the basis for Moderna&rsquo;s investigational new drug application (IND), which was successfully reviewed by the FDA and set the stage for Phase 2 testing. A Phase 2 trial of 600 healthy participants evaluating 25 \u00b5g, 100 \u00b5g, and 250 \u00b5g dose levels of the vaccine was completed, and mRNA-1273 has advanced to a Phase 3 trial (NCT04405076). Study Design: A Phase 3 trial of 30,000 participants at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection who will receive a 100 \u00b5g dose of mRNA-1273 or placebo and then followed for up to 2 years (COVE trial; NCT04470427). Moderna  posted the full trial protocol for COVE on 17 September.  Outcomes: Animal studies - Results from a challenge in a mouse model showed mRNA-1273 prevented viral replication in the lungs, and neutralizing titers in the mouse model were similar in participants receiving 25 \u00b5g or 100 \u00b5g doses of the vaccine. A study of nonhuman primates challenged with SARS-CoV-2 published in the New England Journal of Medicine had neutralizing activity, and limited inflammation and lung activity after being administered the vaccine. A paper published in Nature also showed mRNA-1273 induced neutralizing antibodies in mice. Human studies - Phase 1 data published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed mRNA-1273 successfully produced neutralizing antibody titers in 8 participants who received either 25 \u00b5g or 100 \u00b5g doses. The response was dose dependent in 45 participants across 25 \u00b5g, 100 \u00b5g, and 250 \u00b5g dose levels. In participants with available antibody data, neutralizing antibody titers were on par with what has been in seen in convalescent sera from people who have successfully fought off COVID-19. The vaccine also appears to be safe for older adults, with participants who received two 25 \u03bcg or 100 \u03bcg doses of the vaccine experiencing mild or moderate effects consisting of fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and injection site pain, according to data from the Phase 1 trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Status: On 12 May, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to mRNA-1273. A Phase 3 trial of the vaccine is underway, which is being funded by Operation Warp Speed. The UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has begun a real-time review of mRNA-1273, which will allow a quicker approval process for the vaccine.\n\n",

A Phase 2b trial is underway in South Africa, which includes two cohorts: a group of 2,665 healthy adults and a group of 240 adults who are HIV positive (NCT04533399). Outcomes: On 4 August, Novavax announced positive Phase 1 results for NVX-CoV2373 indicating participants who had received the vaccine developed an antibody response in participants at multiple dose levels.

It has been implicated in helping to combat other infections outside TB by boosting the immune system to fight similar infections. In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO)&nbsp;reported&nbsp;the BCG vaccine may be effective against leprosy and other nontuberculous mycobacteria such as buruli ulcer disease. Other papers have posited the vaccine is effective in preventing acute&nbsp;respiratory tract infections&nbsp;in elderly patients, other&nbsp;respiratory infection and sepsis. A non-peer reviewed paper posted in March 2020 on the preprint server medRxiv has suggested countries with BCG vaccination programs at childhood are&nbsp;faring better&nbsp;in the fight against COVID-19 compared with countries that do not require BCG vaccination. Trials: BCG vaccines are being studied in the randomized, controlled, Phase 3 BRACE trial, which aims to recruit 4,170 healthcare workers in hospitals in Australia (NCT04327206). Researchers in The Netherlands launched the randomized, parallel-assignment, phase 3 BCG-CORONA trial on 31 March and plan to enroll 1,500 healthcare workers to receive the BCG vaccine or placebo (NCT04328441).

Outcomes: A paper published in Science Advances found countries that required BCG vaccination until the year 2000 had significantly slower growth rates of COVID-19 compared with countries that did not mandate the vaccine. However, a birth cohort study published in Clinical Infectious Diseases found the BCG tuberculosis vaccine did not have a protective effect against COVID-19 in more than 1 million individuals born in Sweden who received the vaccine. A letter published in the journal PNAS where researchers analyzed mortality rates in countries with higher rates of BCG vaccination such as Bolivia, Panama, Columbia, Peru, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Germany found that the negative association between the BCG vaccination and COVID-19 related deaths appears to be diminishing.

Robust immunogenicity was seen after vaccination at all three doses (10 &mu;g, 30 &mu;g and 100 &mu;g). Adverse events were elevated at the highest dose; therefore, participants did not receive a second dose at that level. Participants who received two doses between 1 and 50 \u00b5g of BNT162b1 had \"robust RBD-specific antibody, T-cell and favourable cytokine responses,\" according to a paper published in Nature on 30 September.

EMA has initiated a rolling review of BNT162b2, which could accelerate approval of the candidate.

Study Design: As of 28 April, the company had enrolled 40 healthy volunteers in a a non-randomized, open label Phase 1 (NCT04336410) trial, according to a&nbsp;press release. Participants were to receive one or two intradermal injections (1.0 mg) of INO-4800 at baseline and at 4 weeks, followed by electroporation. Preclinical data were published in Nature Communications and showed that mice and guinea pigs who received INO-4800 demonstrated neutralizing antibodies as well as humoral and T cell responses. In guinea pigs, researchers observed protein binding antibody titers and blocking of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)/SARS-CoV-2 S proteins. Outcomes: On 30 July, Inovio reported positive results from a trial where rhesus macaques received INO-4800 and were challenged with SARS-CoV-2.
