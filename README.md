## Data

The worldwide case statistics are provided and regularly updated by [worldometers.info](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) and accessed through the [NovelCOVID REST API](https://github.com/NovelCovid/API).  
Data is saved in the local database and updated once per 5 minutes to not overload the [API](https://github.com/NovelCovid/API) endpoint with telegram requests.
